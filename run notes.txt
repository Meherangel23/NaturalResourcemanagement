Create new web application Natural Resource Management, with Solar Irrigation & Waterlift System 
  Objective
Design and develop a vibrant, responsive web application that empowers users to explore, customize, and deploy solar-powered irrigation and waterlift systems. The platform should combine rich visuals, interactive tools, and intelligent backend logic to support sustainable agriculture.

 Tech Stack
- Frontend: Angular 17 with Angular Material for UI components and responsiveness
- Backend: FastAPI (Python) for RESTful APIs and chatbot logic
- Database: SQLite or PostgreSQL (optional, for persistent design plans or user data)
- Deployment: Dockerized services, hosted on Render/Vercel/Azure

 Key Features
1. Hero Section
- Full-width background of solar panels and farmland
- Overlay text with CTA button (“Explore Solutions”)
2. Navigation Bar
- Sticky top bar with icons and links: Home, About, Solutions, Design Tool, Case Studies, Contact
3. About Section
- Split layout with mission statement and animated infographic showing solar-to-crop flow
4. Solutions Section
- Grid of cards for various offerings: Drip Kits, Solar Pumps, Hybrid Systems, Monitoring Tools
5. Interactive Design Tool
- Angular form to input land size, water source, crop type
- FastAPI endpoint returns recommended pump capacity, solar panel sizing, and system plan
6. Case Studies Gallery
- Masonry-style image thumbnails with hover overlays
- Filter by region or crop type
7. Chatbot Integration
- Angular chatbot component with live chat interface
- FastAPI endpoint handles rule-based or AI-enhanced responses
- Optional: Expand to NLP model or Copilot API for smarter replies
8. Footer
- Contact info, social media icons, newsletter signup

🔧 Developer Notes
- Use Angular Material themes for vibrant color palette (sunshine yellow, eco green, sky blue)
- Ensure mobile responsiveness and accessibility
- Backend should be modular with routers for chatbot and design logic
- Consider caching or storing user-generated plans for future retrieval




To run the backend:

Navigate to the backend directory: cd NaturalResourceManagement\backend
Install the required Python packages: pip install -r requirements.txt
Start the FastAPI server: uvicorn app.main:app --reload
The API will be available at http://127.0.0.1:8000.


To run the frontend:

In a separate terminal, navigate to the frontend directory: cd NaturalResourceManagement\frontend
Install the Node.js dependencies: npm install
Start the Angular development server: ng serve
The web application will be available at http://localhost:4200
